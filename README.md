Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language.

These are my solutions.

### Day 01 ###
1. Determine number of readings are higher than previous reading
2. Determine how many readings from a rolling frame of 3 readings are larger than the previous sum

### Day 02 ###
1. Determine the product of the final distance and depth after all movements
2. Determine the product of the final distance and depth after adjusting for an "aim" value, which is the cumulative deflection of up/down measurements.

### Day 03 ###
1. Determine the product of two binary-encoded integers, which are derived from a set of readings
2. Reduce and refine the dataset bit by bit based on a progressive criteria.
